    <strong>Open-Source LLM Zoomcamp: Building and Deploying LLMs on AMD Hardware</strong>
</h1>

<p align="center">
Welcome to the Open-Source LLM Zoomcamp, where we'll explore how to build, tune, and deploy large language models together. We'll be using AMD's MI300x GPUs (hosted on Saturn Cloud) to learn hands-on with open-source LLMs.

# Homework

## Assignment: Fine-Tuning an Open-Source LLM

The goal of this homework is to get hands-on experience with fine-tuning an open-source LLM for a specific use case.

### Part 1: Model Fine-Tuning

Choose a base model (e.g., DeepSeek R1) and:
1. Prepare a suitable dataset for your use case
2. Configure the fine-tuning process
3. Run the training
4. Document the following metrics:
   * Training time
   * Resource usage
   * Loss curves
   * Evaluation metrics
5. Compare the fine-tuned model with the base model

### Part 2: Model Evaluation

Using your fine-tuned model:
1. Set up an evaluation pipeline that measures:
   * Task-specific metrics
   * Generation quality
   * Response consistency
2. Compare performance with the base model
3. Document improvements and limitations

# Final Project

The goal of this project is to fine-tune and deploy an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) for a specific domain application.

## Problem Statement

Build an end-to-end LLM application by:

* Selecting a dataset for a specific domain (e.g., legal documents, medical data, technical documentation)
* Creating a data processing pipeline to prepare the data for fine-tuning
* Fine-tuning an open-source LLM (e.g., Llama 2, Mistral, or other suitable models)
* Deploying the model with an API endpoint
* Building a simple interface to interact with the model
